MXP1: Xml Pull Parser 3rd Edition (XPP3)
========================================

This repository is forked from [XPP3](http://www.extreme.indiana.edu/xgws/xsoap/xpp/mxp1/) and javax.xml.namespace.QName is removed.

MXP1 is a stable XmlPull parsing engine that is based on ideas from XPP and in particular XPP2 but completely revised and rewritten to take the best advantage of latest JIT JVMs such as Hotspot in JDK 1.4+.

Introduction
------------

MXP1 was designed to use best available the latest and the most advanced JIT engines such as Hotspot in JDK1.4. If you are working on older JDK then previous engine may work faster (both MXP1 and old engine are included in XPP3 download).

MXP1 has following features:

fast - let me say it again it is fast :-)
small - lot of performance packed in JAR file that is less than 20KB!
easy to use - the parser implements common XML pull parsing API (XMLPULL) described at http://www.xmlpull.org
